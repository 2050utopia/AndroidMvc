Android mvc framework provides more granular life cycles\r\n  - [All fragment life cycles are mapped into FragmentController](#FragmentController-Life-cycles) thus more business logic can be moved into controllers including the ones in life cycles. Apps are more testable on JVM!\r\n  - Easy navigation between pages. Navigation is done in controllers instead of views so navigation can be unit tested on JVM\r\n  - Easy unit test on JVM since controllers don't depend on any Android APIs\r\n  - Run async tasks in controllers and easy mocking of http requests\r\n  - Built in event bus. Event bus also automatically guarantees post event view events on the UI thread\r\n  - Automatically save and restore instance state. You don't have to touch onSaveInstance and onCreate(savedInstanceState) with countless key-value pairs, it's all managed by the framework.\r\n  - [Dependency injection with Poke to make mock easy](https://github.com/kejunxia/AndroidMvc/tree/master/library/poke)\r\n  - Well tested - non-Android components are tested as the test coverage status [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/kejunxia/AndroidMvc/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/kejunxia/AndroidMvc). For Android dependent module \"android-mvc\", it's tested by real emulator with [this UI test module](https://github.com/kejunxia/AndroidMvc/tree/master/library/android-mvc-test). **It's also tested with \"Don't Keep Activities\" turned on in dev options** to guarantee your app doesn't crash due to loss of instance state after it's killed by OS in the background!\r\n\r\n## Implement MVC/MVP/MVVM pattern\r\nAs we know MVP and MVVM patterns are just simply derivatives of MVC pattern. All of them are targeting the same goal - Separation. \r\n\r\nSeparating Views and Controllers allows moving more business logic away from views into controllers. This makes code cleaner and, more importantly, it makes code more testable since most logical components are not depending on specific views. In the sense of Android, it means more fuctions can be written without depending on Android API therefore not have to be tested on emulators.\r\n\r\nSince MVC, MVP and MVVM are similar, in this framework we call both **Prestener** in MVP and **ViewModel** in MVVM just as traditionally **Controller**. \r\n\r\n- **Controller**: A controller is a delegate for business logic of a view. Thus controllers and views have **one-to-one** relationship. A controller provides methods to be invoked by the view to receive user's interactions such as click and long press. Once user's input is processed in controller, the state of view would be changed. And the controller needs to notify the view the change. When the controller needs to update view, it can be done differently in MVP and MVVM pattern\r\n  - In **MVP**: controller calls the method view.update() of the view it holds to update the entire view. If the needed, the view can define more granular methods to update just a part of the entire view. For example, view.showProgressBar() or view.hideProgressBar().\r\n  - In **MVVM**: controller post an event to view. View uses methods onEvent([EventClassType] event) to mointore the posted event. In the mothods the view update the UI accordingly.\r\n  \r\n- **View**: A view is an Android component that can be either Fragments, Services, Notification, Activity and etc. Every view has a controller to manage its business logic. As metioned, controllers and views have **one-to-one** relationship. Views should not process business logic but delegate all business processes to their corespondingcontrollers.\r\n  - Note that, AndroidMvc is use a single Activity to host multiple fragments. Navgation is at fragment level and in the same activity.\r\n- **Model**: A model represents the state of view and managed by controller. It can be accessed by controller.getModel(). The model should be reflected to Android UI in views and modified by controllers. **The model will be automatically searialized and restored in onSaveInstanceState by the framework**. So you don't need to use messy key-value pairs to save and restore view state.\r\n- **Managers**: Managers are not necessary in MVC/MVP/MVVM model. However as metioned above, views and controllers are one-to-one mapped, when multiple views as well as their controllers share same data or logic managers are a good fit. Shared logic and data of controllers can be broken out into a manager. For example, managing logged in user is common feature of a lot apps. To have a UserManager is a perfect solution that can modify and read current users. The the manager can be used by LoginController and other controllers after login screen.\r\n- **Services**: We are not taling about [Android Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html). Services here are providing a layer between controller controllers and external data such as http apis, database, files, sharedPreferences and etc. Services can be injected into controllers as well as managers since managers can be thought as partial controllers.\r\n  Services abstract out data access logic so that they can be replaced by different implementations. e.g. Use database to replace sharedPreference when the data structure become complex and query is required. In addition, the controllers can use mocked data provided by mocked services for **unit tests**.\r\n\r\nSee the diagram illustrating the relation between components above\r\n\r\n![AndroidMvc Layers](http://i.imgur.com/dfW8TLM.png)\r\n\r\n#### Sample code to implement MVP\r\n- This sample shosw how a simple view just simply binds the model to the view\r\n    ```java\r\n    //Base view interface defined in AndroidMvc framework\r\n    public interface UiView {\r\n    \tvoid update();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //Base controller defined in AndroidMvc framework\r\n    public abstract class Controller<MODEL, VIEW extends UiView> extends Bean<MODEL> {\r\n    \tprotected VIEW view;\r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //A concrete controller extending Controller\r\n    public class SomeController extends Controller<SomeController.Model, UiView> {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Class modelType() {\r\n            return SomeController.class;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \t//The model of the controller that represents the state of the view\r\n        public static class Model {\r\n            String title;\r\n            public String getTitle() {\r\n                return title;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void updateTitle(String text) {\r\n            //Model is updated\r\n            getModel().title = text;\r\n            //Notify the view. The implementation of method update() in \r\n            //concrete view, the view reads the model of the controller \r\n            //and reflect the model to UI\r\n            view.update();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //View paired with the controller \r\n    public class SomeView implements UiView {\r\n        private TextView title;\r\n    \r\n        @Inject\r\n        private SomeController someController;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void update() {\r\n        \t//Read the controller's model and bind it to text\r\n            title.setText(someController.getModel().getTitle());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n- This sample shosw how a more complicated view defines extract methods to update view partially. However, this can also be done only with binding model appoach. For example, define a flag in the model, when the flag changes the controller call view.update() which show loading UI according to the flag.\r\n    ```java\r\n    //Extend UiView to define granular methods to update view partially instead of binding\r\n    //entire model to the view\r\n    public interface AsyncView extends UiView {\r\n        void showLoadingStatus();\r\n        void hideLoadingStatus();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //A screen view that extends MvcFragment\r\n    public static class LoginScreen extends MvcFragment<LoginController> implements AsyncView{\r\n        private EditText username;\r\n        private EditText password;\r\n        private Button button;\r\n\r\n        //Specify the class type of the paired controller\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected Class<LoginController> getControllerClass() {\r\n            return LoginController.class;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected int getLayoutResId() {\r\n            return R.id.screen_login;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        //Called when the view is ready. Similar to onViewCreated but this\r\n        //callback guaranteed all injectable instances depended by this view are ready\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onViewReady(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState, Reason reason) {\r\n            super.onViewReady(view, savedInstanceState, reason);\r\n\r\n            //assign view by findViewById\r\n            //...\r\n            button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onClick(View view) {\r\n                    controller.login(username.getText().toString(),\r\n                            password.getText().toString());\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void showLoadingStatus() {\r\n            //Show progress dialog or progress bar\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void hideLoadingStatus() {\r\n            //Hide progress dialog or progress bar\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void update() {\r\n            //Bind model here\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class LoginController extends FragmentController<Void, AsyncView> {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Class<Void> modelType() {\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void

                //Task.execute methods runs on non-UI thread, so we need to\r\n                    //post the view update logic back to UI thread\r\n                    uiThreadRunner.post(new

     });\r\n\r\n                    //Send a http request to login\r\n                    //...\r\n                    //Request returns successfully\r\n\r\n                    //Task.execute methods runs on non-UI thread, so we need to\r\n                    //post the view update logic back to UI thread\r\n                    uiThreadRunner.post(new Runnable() {\r\n

null;\r\n                }\r\n            }, new Task.Callback<Void>() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onException(Exception e) throws Exception {\r\n                    //Call back is guaranteed to run on UI thread by the framework\r\n                    //No need to use uiThreadRunner to post action\r\n                    view.hideLoadingStatus();\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n#### Sample code to implement MVVM\r\n```java\r\n//A concrete controller as a ViewModel\r\n    public static class SomeController extends Controller<SomeController.Model, UiView> {\r\n        interface Event {\r\n            class OnModelUpdated {\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            class OnTitleChanged {\r\n                private

implement apps with a single Activity in most cases. Fragments are playing an important role. In the framework, fragments can be used as a screen which is the what an activity does traditionally. Also it can be used as sub view as well.\r\n\r\nBelow are life cycle callback of MvcFragment provided by AndroidMvc framework\r\n- **onCreateView** is final and **SEALED**, use onViewReady described below\r\n- **onViewCreated** is final and **SEALED**, use onViewReady described below\r\n- **onViewReady**(View, Bundle, **Reason**) is called when the fragement is ready to bind Android widgets by findViewById and **use controllers**. The argument \"Reason\" indicates why the view is created or recreated. For example, view is created\r\n  - first time\r\n  - on restoration\r\n  - rotation.\r\n- **onReturnForeground** called when the app is brought to the front after being pushed to background. It complements onResume since onResume doesn't differentiate foregrounding app, rotation, creation and etc.\r\n- **onPushToBackStack** called when the fragment is about to be pushed to back stack typically on navigation. It complements onPause since onPause doesn't differentiate pushing to back stack, removing fragment, rotation and etc.\r\n- **onPoppedOutToFront** called when the fragment is popping out from the fragment backstack to present as the top most fragment.\r\n- **onPopAway** called when the fragment was the top most presenting fragment but will be popped away and replaced by the fragment will pop out under it.\r\n- **onPreNavigationTransaction(FragmentTransaction transaction, MvcFragment nextFragment)** called before the fragment transaction is about to commit that will replace current fragment by the next. It's main providing the transaction being committed to configure transaction animation. e.g adding SharedElements\r\n- **onOrientationChanged** called when orientation changed.\r\n\r\n## FragmentController Life cycles\r\nAll fragment life cycles are mapped into [FragmentController](https://github.com/kejunxia/AndroidMvc/blob/master/library/android-mvc-core/src/main/java/com/shipdream/lib/android/mvc/FragmentController.java). So fragments are further liberated from handling business logic. For example, if you need to do some stuff in Framgent.onViewReady, you can do it in FragmentController.onViewReady.\r\n\r\nHere are the life cycles\r\n- **onCreate** when the controller is injected into the corresponding fragment\r\n- **onViewReady(Reason)** is called when the fragement is ready to show. The argument \"Reason\" indicates why the view is created or recreated. For example, view is created\r\n  - first time\r\n  - on restoration\r\n  - rotation.\r\n- **onResume** callced when the fragment is calling its own onResume\r\n- **onPasue** called when the fragment is calling its own onPuase\r\n- **onDestroy** called when the controller is released from being used by the corresponding fragment and not referenced by anything it was injected to.\r\n- **onBackButtonPressed()** called when the phycical back button is pressed\r\n- **onReturnForeground** samed as the corresponding life cycle callback in fragment\r\n- **onPushToBackStack** samed as the corresponding life cycle callback in fragment\r\n- **onPoppedOutToFront** samed as the corresponding life cycle callback in fragment\r\n- **onPopAway** samed as the corresponding life cycle callback in fragment\r\n- **onOrientationChanged** called when orientation changed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Below are old documents for AndroidMvc below 2.3.0. They will be updated.\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Using AndroidMvc\r\n\r\nLet's take a simple app counting number as an example. The counter app has two navigation locations:\r\n1. LocationA: presented by FragmentA\r\n   * One text view to display the current count in number. Updated by event OnCounterUpdated\r\n   * Two buttons which increment and decrement count **on click**.\r\n   * An nested fragment with a TextView to display count in English. Updated by event OnCounterUpdated too\r\n   * An button to show advance view which results in navigating to LocationB\r\n   * Shares the result of counting updated by LocationB\r\n2. LocationB: presented by FragmentB\r\n   * One text view to display the current count in number. Updated by event OnCounterUpdated\r\n   * Two buttons which increment and decrement count **continuously on hold**.\r\n   * Shares the result of counting updated by LocationB\r\n\r\nBelow is how to use AndroidMvc framework to implement and test the app including navigation.

Implement the controller\r\n**Note that, to allow AndroidMvc to find the default implementation of injectable object, the implementation class must be under the sub-package \"internal\" which resides in the same parent package as the interface and the name must be [InterfaceName]Impl.** For this example, say CounterController is under package samples.simple.controller the  implementation must be named as CounterControllerImpl and placed under package samples.simple.controller.internal\r\n````java\r\n/**\r\n * Note the structure of the package name.

Inject Controller into Views, setup views and handle C2V events from controllers\r\n````java\r\npublic class FragmentA extends MvcFragment {\r\n\t@Inject\r\n    private CounterController counterController;\r\n\r\n    private TextView display;\r\n    private Button increment;\r\n    private Button decrement;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return Layout id used to inflate the view of this MvcFragment.\r\n     */\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected int getLayoutResId() {\r\n        return R.layout.fragment_a;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Lifecycle similar to onViewCreated by with more granular control with an extra argument to\r\n     * indicate why this view is created: 1. first time created, or 2. rotated or 3. restored\r\n     * @param view The root view of the fragment\r\n     * @param savedInstanceState The savedInstanceState when the fragment is being recreated after\r\n     *                           its enclosing activity is killed by OS, otherwise null including on\r\n     *                           rotation\r\n     * @param reason Indicates the {@link Reason} why the onViewReady is called.\r\n     */\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onViewReady(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState, Reason reason) {\r\n        super.onViewReady(view, savedInstanceState, reason);\r\n\r\n        display = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.fragment_a_counterDisplay);\r\n        increment = (Button) view.findViewById(R.id.fragment_a_buttonIncrement);\r\n        decrement = (Button) view.findViewById(R.id.fragment_a_buttonDecrement);\r\n\r\n        increment.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onClick(View v) {\r\n                counterController.increment(v);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        decrement.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onClick(View v) {\r\n                counterController.decrement(v);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        updateCountDisplay(counterController.getModel().getCount());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Callback when the fragment is popped out by back navigation\r\n     */\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onPoppedOutToFront() {\r\n        super.onPoppedOutToFront();\r\n        updateCountDisplay(counterController.getModel().getCount());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //Define event handler by method named as onEvent with single parameter of the event type\r\n    //to respond event CounterController.EventC2V.OnCounterUpdated\r\n    private void onEvent(CounterController.EventC2V.OnCounterUpdated event) {\r\n        updateCountDisplay(event.getCount());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Update the text view of count number\r\n     * @param count The number of count\r\n     */\r\n    private void updateCountDisplay(int count) {\r\n        display.setText(String.valueOf(count));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 5. Unit tests on controllers\r\nAs discussed before, business logic should be decoupled from view(Android components) and abstracted to controllers, then we can pretty much test most logic just on controllers without dependencies of any Android components. Views just need to make sure data carried back from controllers are displayed correctly. Whether or not the data is processed correctly is completely controllers' responsibilities that is what is being tested here.\r\n\r\n````java\r\npublic class TestCounterController {\r\n\t...other dependencies are omitted here\r\n\r\n    private CounterController counterController;\r\n\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void setUp() throws Exception {\r\n    \t...other dependencies are omitted here\r\n\r\n        //create instance of CounterController\r\n        counterController = new CounterControllerImpl();\r\n        counterController.init();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void increment_should_post_counter_update_event_with_incremented_value() {\r\n        //1. Prepare\r\n        //prepare event monitor\r\n        class Monitor {\r\n            void onEvent(CounterController.EventC2V.OnCounterUpdated event) {\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        Monitor monitor = mock(Monitor.class);\r\n        eventBusC2V.register(monitor);\r\n\r\n        //mock controller model for count value\r\n        int value = new Random().nextInt();\r\n        CounterModel counterModel = mock(CounterModel.class);\r\n        when(counterModel.getCount()).thenReturn(value);\r\n        //Bind the mock model to the controller\r\n        counterController.bindModel(this, counterModel);\r\n\r\n        //2. Act\r\n        counterController.increment(this);\r\n\r\n        //3. Verify\r\n        ArgumentCaptor<CounterController.EventC2V.OnCounterUpdated> updateEvent\r\n                = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(CounterController.EventC2V.OnCounterUpdated.class);\r\n        //event should be fired once\r\n        verify(monitor, times(1)).onEvent(updateEvent.capture());\r\n        //event should carry incremented value\r\n        Assert.assertEquals(value + 1, updateEvent.getValue().getCount());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 5. Navigation\r\nInstead creating, replacing or popping full screen fragments by FragmentManager of Android Activity, AndroidMvc provides NavigationManager to manage navigation. Therefore, navigation logic can be abstracted out from View layer. To make navigation easier to be tested, we can inject NavigationManager to CounterController and then test the model of NavigationManager to verify if navigation location is changed as expected.\r\n##### 5.1. Add two methods to CounterController to wrap navigation logic\r\n````java\r\npublic interface CounterController extends BaseController<CounterModel> {\r\n\t... other methods\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Navigate to LocationB by {@link NavigationManager}to show advance view that can update\r\n     * count continuously by holding buttons.\r\n     * @param sender\r\n     */\r\n    void goToAdvancedView(Object sender);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Navigate back to LocationA by {@link NavigationManager}to show basic view from LocationB\r\n     * @param sender\r\n     */\r\n    void goBackToBasicView(Object sender);\r\n\r\n\t... other methods\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 5.2. Inject NavigationManager to CounterControllerImpl and implement navigation methods\r\n````java\r\npublic class CounterControllerImpl extends BaseControllerImpl<CounterModel> implements CounterController{\r\n\t... other methods\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    NavigationManager navigationManager;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void goToAdvancedView(Object sender) {\r\n        navigationManager.navigate(sender).to(\"LocationB\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void goBackToBasicView(Object sender) {\r\n        navigationManager.navigate(sender).back();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ... other methods\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 5.3. Invoke CounterController methods wrapping navigation in views\r\n````java\r\npublic class FragmentA extends MvcFragment {\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onViewReady(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState, Reason reason) {\r\n        super.onViewReady(view, savedInstanceState, reason);\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        buttonShowAdvancedView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onClick(View v) {\r\n                //Use counterController to manage navigation to make navigation testable\r\n                counterController.goToAdvancedView(v);\r\n                //Or we can use navigationManager directly though it's harder to unit test on\r\n                //controller level.\r\n                //example:\r\n                //navigationManager.navigateTo(v, \"LocationB\");\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class FragmentB extends MvcFragment {\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean onBackButtonPressed() {\r\n        //Use counterController to manage navigation back make navigation testable\r\n        counterController.goBackToBasicView(this);\r\n        //Return true to not pass the back button pressed event to upper level handler.\r\n        return true;\r\n        //Or we can let the fragment manage back navigation back automatically where we don't\r\n        //override this method which will call NavigationManager.navigate(this).back()\r\n        //automatically\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 5.4. Able to test navigation on CounterController\r\n````java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void should_navigate_to_locationB_when_go_to_advance_view_and_back_to_locationA_after_go_to_basic_view() {\r\n        //Prepare\r\n        NavigationManager navigationManager = ((CounterControllerImpl) counterController).navigationManager;\r\n        NavigationManager.Model navModel = navigationManager.getModel();\r\n        //App has not navigated to anywhere, current location should be null\r\n        Assert.assertNull(navModel.getCurrentLocation());\r\n        //Simulate navigating to location A\r\n        navigationManager.navigateTo(this, \"LocationA\");\r\n        //Verify: location should be changed to LocationA\r\n        Assert.assertEquals(navModel.getCurrentLocation().getLocationId(), \"LocationA\");\r\n\r\n        //Act: CounterController now goes to advanced view underlining logic is navigating to locationB\r\n        counterController.goToAdvancedView(this);\r\n\r\n        //Verify: Current location should be LocationB\r\n        Assert.assertEquals(navModel.getCurrentLocation().getLocationId(), \"LocationB\");\r\n\r\n        //Act: CounterController now goes back to basic view underlining logic is navigating back to locationA\r\n        counterController.goBackToBasicView(this);\r\n\r\n        //Verify: Current location should be back to LocationA\r\n        Assert.assertEquals(navModel.getCurrentLocation().getLocationId(), \"LocationA\");\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Other features\r\n#### 1. Dependency Injection\r\n\r\n##### @Inject\r\n\r\nThe framework currently only support field injection. To inject an object, use @Inject to annotate fields and then inject the object with those fields by\r\n````java\r\nAndroidMvc.graph().inject(ObjectToBeInjected)\r\n````\r\nAll injected objects will be reference counted. This is because\r\nthe graph will automatically save and restore injected objects implementing StateManaged. For performance reasons the injected but not anymore referenced objects don't need to be saved and restored. So don't forget to call\r\n````java\r\nAndroidMvc.graph().release(ObjectBeenInjected)\r\n````\r\nto dereference them. Fortunately, all MvcFragment will do the injection and releasing in their\r\nAndroid lifecycle - onCreate and onDestroy. So we don't need to do this manually for fragments.\r\n\r\n**But why do we release? Isn't Java managing garbage collection automatically?\r\n\r\nYes java does it. But since all controllers of AndroidMvc are singleton to assure the single source of truth, if there are used by multiple consumers, the shared instance of the controller will be held by a cache. And the model of the controller will be automatically saved and restored on demand of recreation and destroy of fragments. So if a controller is not used anymore, we can dereference the controller. Then AndroidMvc will stop managing its model.\r\n\r\nIn addition, instances of fragments in their back stack will be held by OS until they are killed. This holds up a lot memory if the back stack is deep. Since those fragments are not visible, there is no point to hold the data they are referencing any longer. To release reference of controllers will help AndroidMvc be aware which controllers are not used anymore, thereafter AndroidMvc can free up the memory holding their models. What about if those fragments want to resume by popping out from the back stack? As mentioned before, AndroidMvc will restore the state/model of the controllers the fragments reference which are saved when the fragments are pushed into the back stack.**\r\n\r\n#### [More details about dependency injection with Poke, see its documentation here](https://github.com/kejunxia/AndroidMvc/tree/master/library/poke)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Unit testing on asynchronous actions, e.g. Http requests\r\nBelow is an example to consume a public weather API from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api). To be able to test controller without real http communication, the http request can be abstracted into a service interface. The service interface is injected into controllers. Then in real implementation of the service interface we send http request by http client while in controller testings we mock the service to provide mock data.\r\n\r\nSee more details in the sample project - Node\r\n\r\n**Note that, BaseMvcControllerImpl provides protected methods to run actions asynchronously. The ExecutorService is injected into controllers. By default, AndroidMvc framework automatically injects with an implementation running tasks on non-main thread. Whereas in unit tests we can override the injection with an implementation runs the task on the same thread as the caller's so that the asynchronous actions can be tested easier.**\r\n````java\r\n/**\r\n * Run async task on the default ExecutorService injected as a field of this class. Exceptions\r\n * occur during running the task will be handled by the given {@link AsyncExceptionHandler}.\r\n *\r\n * @param sender                who initiated this task\r\n * @param asyncTask             task to execute\r\n * @param asyncExceptionHandler error handler for the exception during running the task\r\n * @return the reference of {@link AsyncTask} that can be used to query its state and cancel it.\r\n */\r\nprotected AsyncTask runAsyncTask(Object sender, AsyncTask asyncTask, AsyncExceptionHandler asyncExceptionHandler)\r\n````\r\n\r\n##### 1. Define http service interface\r\n````java\r\npackage com.shipdream.lib.android.mvc.samples.note.service.http;\r\n\r\npublic interface WeatherService {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get weathers of the cities with the given ids\r\n     * @param ids Ids of the cities\r\n     * @return The response\r\n     */\r\n    WeatherListResponse getWeathers(List<Integer>ids) throws IOException;\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 2. Send and consume real http service in implementation\r\n````java\r\n/**\r\n * Note the package structure which is under internal subpackage sharing the same parent package as\r\n * WeatherService as above\r\n */\r\npackage com.shipdream.lib.android.mvc.samples.note.service.http.internal;\r\n\r\npublic class WeatherServiceImpl implements WeatherService{\r\n    private HttpClient httpClient;\r\n    private Gson gson;\r\n\r\n    public WeatherServiceImpl() {\r\n        httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();\r\n        gson = new Gson();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public WeatherListResponse getWeathers(List<Integer> ids) throws IOException {\r\n        String idsStr = \"\";\r\n        for (Integer id : ids) {\r\n            if (!idsStr.isEmpty()) {\r\n                idsStr += \", \";\r\n            }\r\n            idsStr += String.valueOf(id);\r\n        }\r\n        String url = String.format(\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/group?id=%s&units=metric\",\r\n                URLEncoder.encode(idsStr, \"UTF-8\"));\r\n        HttpGet get = new HttpGet(url);\r\n        HttpResponse resp = httpClient.execute(get);\r\n        String responseStr = EntityUtils.toString(resp.getEntity());\r\n        return gson.fromJson(responseStr, WeatherListResponse.class);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 3. Inject the http service into WeatherControllerImpl\r\n````java\r\npublic class WeatherControllerImpl extends BaseControllerImpl <WeatherModel> implements\r\n        WeatherController{\r\n\t....\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    private WeatherService weatherService;\r\n\r\n    //consume the service and fetch weathers\r\n    //...\r\n}\r\n````\r\n##### 4. In controller unit test, override injection of ExecutorService with implementation running actions on the same thread as the caller's\r\nCode below is partial implementation, see sample Note in the project for more details.\r\n````java\r\npublic class TestWeatherController extends TestControllerBase<WeatherController> {\r\n@Override\r\nprotected void registerDependencies(MvcGraph mvcGraph) {\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\t//Setup mock executor service mock that runs task on the same thread.\r\n\texecutorService = mock(ExecutorService.class);\r\n\tdoAnswer(new Answer() {\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\r\n\t\t\tRunnable runnable = (Runnable) invocation.getArguments()[0];\r\n\t\t\trunnable.run();\r\n\t\t\treturn null;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}).when(executorService).submit(any(Runnable.class));\r\n\r\n    //Register the injecting component to mvcGraph to override the implementation being injected\r\n    //to controllers\r\n\tTestComp testComp = new TestComp();\r\n\ttestComp.testNoteController = this;\r\n\tmvcGraph.register(testComp);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n##### 5. Test if WeatherController sends successful event with good http response\r\nWhat to mock\r\n1. Http Service to provide good response\r\n2. Event monitor to subscribe to the successful event\r\nSo when WeatherController#updateAllCities(Object) is called, we can verify whether the mocked monitor receives the successful event.\r\n\r\n````java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void shouldRaiseSuccessEventForGoodUpdateWeathers() throws IOException {\r\n\t//---Arrange---\r\n\t//Define a subscriber class\r\n\tclass Monitor {\r\n\t\tpublic void onEvent(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdated event) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tpublic void onEvent(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdateFailed event) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tMonitor monitor = mock(Monitor.class);\r\n    //Subscribe to eventBus\r\n\teventBusC2V.register(monitor);\r\n\r\n    //Weather service mock prepares a good response\r\n\tWeatherListResponse responseMock = mock(WeatherListResponse.class);\r\n\twhen(weatherServiceMock.getWeathers(any(List.class))).thenReturn(responseMock);\r\n\r\n\t//---Action---\r\n\tcontrollerToTest.updateAllCities(this);\r\n\r\n\t//---Verify---\r\n\t//Success event should be raised\r\n\tArgumentCaptor<WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdated> eventSuccess\r\n\t\t\t= ArgumentCaptor.forClass(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdated.class);\r\n\tverify(monitor, times(1)).onEvent(eventSuccess.capture());\r\n\t//Failed event should not be raised\r\n\tArgumentCaptor<WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdateFailed> eventFailure\r\n\t\t\t= ArgumentCaptor.forClass(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdateFailed.class);\r\n\tverify(monitor, times(0)).onEvent(eventFailure.capture());\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n##### 6. **Test if WeatherController sends failed event with bad http response**\r\nWhat to mock\r\n1. Http Service to provide bad response\r\n2. Event monitor to subscribe to the failed event\r\nSo when WeatherController#updateAllCities(Object) is called, we can verify whether the mocked monitor receives the failed event.\r\n````java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void shouldRaiseFailEventForNetworkErrorToUpdateWeathers() throws IOException {\r\n\t//---Arrange---\r\n\t//Define a subscriber class\r\n\tclass Monitor {\r\n\t\tpublic void onEvent(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdated event) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tpublic void onEvent(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdateFailed event) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tMonitor monitor = mock(Monitor.class);\r\n    //Subscribe to eventBus\r\n\teventBusC2V.register(monitor);\r\n\r\n\t//Weather service mock prepares a bad response\r\n    //by throwing an exception when getting the weather data\r\n\twhen(weatherServiceMock.getWeathers(any(List.class))).thenThrow(new IOException());\r\n\r\n\t//---Action---\r\n\tcontrollerToTest.updateAllCities(this);\r\n\r\n\t//---Verify---\r\n\t//Success event should not be raised\r\n\tArgumentCaptor<WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdated> eventSuccess\r\n\t\t\t= ArgumentCaptor.forClass(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdated.class);\r\n\tverify(monitor, times(0)).onEvent(eventSuccess.capture());\r\n\t//Failed event must be raised\r\n\tArgumentCaptor<WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdateFailed> eventFailure\r\n\t\t\t= ArgumentCaptor.forClass(WeatherController.EventC2V.OnWeathersUpdateFailed.class);\r\n\tverify(monitor, times(1)).onEvent(eventFailure.capture());\r\n}\r\n````\r\n",
